## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been ##calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix, which is really a list containing a function to
## set the matrix
## get the matrix
## set the inverse
## get the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
          x <<- y
          i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
          setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
          getinverse <- function() m
          list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)

}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the matrix created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the ##inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the ##inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        i <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(i)
        i

}
